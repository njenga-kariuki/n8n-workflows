**Header Text:** "J's N8N Workflow Examples"
**Subheader Text:** "Examples of N8N workflows to showcase automation toolkit"

### Data Structure Implementation
**Create `/data/workflows.js` with this exact structure:**
```javascript
export const workflows = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Customer Onboarding Automation",
    category: "CRM",
    description: "Automated welcome sequence that triggers when new customers sign up, sends personalized emails, creates tasks in project management tools, and notifies the sales team.",
    problem: "Manual onboarding was taking 2+ hours per customer and prone to human error",
    integrations: ["Slack", "Gmail", "Airtable", "Calendly"],
    image: "/images/workflows/onboarding-workflow.png",
    impact: "Reduced onboarding time by 85%, improved customer satisfaction"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Social Media Content Pipeline",
    category: "Marketing",
    description: "Automatically schedules social media posts across platforms when new blog content is published, generates relevant hashtags, and tracks engagement metrics.",
    problem: "Content distribution was inconsistent and time-consuming across multiple platforms",
    integrations: ["WordPress", "Twitter API", "LinkedIn", "Buffer", "Google Sheets"],
    image: "/images/workflows/social-media-workflow.png",
    impact: "Increased posting consistency by 300%, saved 10 hours/week"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Lead Qualification System",
    category: "Sales",
    description: "Automatically scores and routes incoming leads based on company size, industry, and engagement level, then assigns to appropriate sales rep.",
    problem: "Sales team was spending too much time on unqualified leads",
    integrations: ["HubSpot", "Clearbit", "Slack", "Gmail"],
    image: "/images/workflows/lead-qualification-workflow.png",
    impact: "Improved lead quality by 60%, reduced qualification time by 70%"
  }
];
```

### Image Handling Instructions
**Image Setup:**
- Create `/public/images/workflows/` directory
- For now, use placeholder images (600x400px) for each workflow
- Generate placeholder images with workflow titles as text overlays
- Use a consistent aspect ratio (3:2) for all workflow images
- Images should be optimized and under 200KB each

**Placeholder Image Creation:**
- Use a tool to create simple placeholder images with the workflow title
- Background: Light gray (#f8f9fa) with dark text
- Include "N8N Workflow" subtitle on each placeholder
- Example filenames: `onboarding-workflow.png`, `social-media-workflow.png`, `lead-qualification-workflow.png`

### Functional Requirements
- Smooth scroll navigation
- Hover effects on workflow cards that show additional details
- Mobile responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop)
- Fast loading with Next.js Image optimization
- Each workflow card should display: image, title, category tag, description, key integrations, and impact metric
- LinkedIn link should open in new tab

### Content Management Approach
- All workflow data imported from `/data/workflows.js`
- Page automatically maps through workflows array to generate cards
- Easy to add new workflows by adding objects to the array
- No code changes needed for content updates

This gives the coding agent everything they need to build the structure correctly with your specific branding and provides you with clear examples for future updates.
